# 📒 Missionaries and Cannibals Game

A Python-based console game where players must help three missionaries and three cannibals cross a river safely — without ever letting cannibals outnumber missionaries on either side!

# 🚀 Key Features

⛵ Move missionaries and cannibals across the river  

⚖️ Keep balance — missionaries must never be outnumbered!  

🎯 Win the game by moving all characters to the left bank safely  

💀 Lose if missionaries are ever outnumbered by cannibals on any side  

🌊 Boat shifts sides after each move  

🧩 Input validation for safe gameplay

# 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3

- Unicode Emojis for graphical representation:

  - 👨‍🎓 (Missionary: `\U0001f482`)

  - 👹 (Cannibal: `\U0001f479`)

  - 🌊 (River: `\U0001f30a`)

  - 🚤 (Boat: `\U0001f6A2`)


# 💻 How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.

2. Save the code into a `.py` file (e.g., `missionaries_cannibals.py`).

3. Open Terminal or Command Prompt.

4. Navigate to the file's location.

5. Run the script:

```bash

python missionaries_cannibals.py
```

# 📂 Game Flow

- Game starts with all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on the right bank.

- The player chooses how many missionaries and cannibals to move (1 or 2 people max at a time).

- After each move:

  - The boat changes sides.


  - The numbers are updated and displayed with emojis.

- **Winning Condition**:

  - All 6 characters safely moved to the left bank.

- **Losing Condition**:

  - At any time, if missionaries are outnumbered by cannibals on either bank and missionaries > 0.

# 📢 Important Rules

- You can move 1 or 2 people at a time only.

- You cannot move more people than are available on your current boat side.

- If missionaries are outnumbered by cannibals, the game ends immediately with "YOU LOSE."
-
- Input is validated — incorrect moves are rejected with a message.

# 📊 Example Gameplay

Would you also like me to create a second, slightly **upgraded version** of your code (like better prompts, cleaner win/lose checking, and maybe randomized emoji positions for fun)? 🎯🚤  
It would make your project even more polished if you're thinking of submitting or presenting it! 🚀Here's a **professional README file** for your **Missionaries and Cannibals** Python game, based directly on your provided code:
